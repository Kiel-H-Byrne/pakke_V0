                <p>Our vision is to enhance and enrich the experience of socializing--the Where, and the Who. The physical environment is just as important to a day or night out that (if done right) we may open our doors as hosts for curated events that keep us all yearning for more Pakke'd Events.
                <br />
                <br />
                Moreover, Pakke's network of hosts, guests, and entertainers, will drive another revenue stream that would have otherwise went to traditional establishments like bars and restaurants. </p>
